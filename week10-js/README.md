## Notes
1. js runs in the browser: response is the code, not the outcome of the code
2. View source: What server send back
3. Inspeact: What is seen, can be changed 
4. The alert() function takes a string as a parameter and pauses the JavaScript execution until you press “OK”.
It completely pause the engine of the browser.
5.   
```
<p><a href="js-01.htm" onclick="alert('Hi'); return false;">Click Me</a></p>
```
Doesn’t go to the link because it returns false.

6. If one .js file has syntax error, nothing happens, just silently die

7. Debugging: pause the js under “source” tab
